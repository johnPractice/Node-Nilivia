# In name of Allah

## Introduction
Here in [Nilva](https://nilva.ir) we love to play trivia games for our gatherings, so to get to know us better, we want you to develop a trivia game.
Simply put, we want a simple trivia game backend. In this game users will be matched together to play a trivia like game, it works like this:
they need to answer 10 questions containing a text and 4 choices for answer, each question can be answered in maximum of 10 seconds. The winner will be chosen based on two parameters:
1. correct answer count: this is the priority in choosing the winner
2. time to answer: if two players answered the questions equally, the faster one will be the winner.

So as a whole this game consists of three parts:
1. authentication: any authentication system you see fit
2. match making: you should implement functionality for matching two players to play
3. question & answer: sending questions to both players, receiving answers & sending the next question till the end of the game and declaring the winner.


### Note
Use Express for framework and socket io for websocket.

## Expectations

So What does matter to us?
- a clean structure of codebase & components
- clean code practices
- well handled exceptions
- finally, ability to learn
